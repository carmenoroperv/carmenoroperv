## Hi there, welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student at the Department of Molecular Medicine (MOMA) at Aarhus University.


ðŸŽ¯ My work mainly focuses on computational methods for whole-genome sequencing data from healthy and diseased tissue.
- sensitive methods for rare variant discovery
- ctDNA detection and quantification
- *de novo* mutations detection
- genomic target prediction based on sequence context 
- epigenetic modifications prediction


ðŸ’» My main computational focus is on:
- Streamlined and distributed genomic data analysis workflows 
- Probabilistic modeling 
- Tree-Based methods 
- Deep learning approaches 
- Probabilistic diffusion models


ðŸ”§ My current tech stack: 
- Coding: R, Python, bash
- Data wrangling and analysis: tidyverse, numpy, pandas
- Probabilistic modeling: STAN, JAGS, Pyro
- Deep learning: PyTorch, Keras
- Workflows: Snakemake, gwf, Nextflow
- Tree-Based modeling: XGBoost, XGBoostLSS, GBM
- Visualization: ggplot, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- SQL
- R shiny
