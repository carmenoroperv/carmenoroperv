## Hi there, welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a PhD student at Department of Molecular Medicine (MOMA) at Aarhus University.


ðŸŽ¯ My work mainly focuses on computational methods for whole-genome sequencing data from both healthy and diseased tissue.
- sensitive methods for rare variant discovery
- ctDNA detection and quantification
- *de novo* mutations detection
- genomic target prediction based on sequence context 
- epigenetic modifications prediction


ðŸ’» My main computational focus is on:
- Streamlined and distributed genomic data analysis workflows (Snakemake, gwf)
- Probabilistic modeling (STAN, pyro, JAGS)
- Tree-Based methods (mainly XGBoost and XGBoostSS, GBM)
- Deep learning approaches (PyTorch)
- Probabilistic diffusion models
