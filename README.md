Here you can get an overview of my current interests and projects. 

I am currently a PhD student at Department of Molecular Medicine (MOMA) at Aarhus University.
My work mainly focuses on computational methods for whole-genome sequence data. 

My main focus is on:
- Streamlined and distributed genomic data analysis workflows (Snakemake, gwf)
- Probabilistic modeling (STAN, pyro, JAGS)
- Tree-Based methods (mainly XGBoost and XGBoostSS, GBM)
- Deep learning approaches (PyTorch)
- Probabilistic diffusion models
